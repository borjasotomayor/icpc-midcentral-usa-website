The 2018 Mid-Central USA Programming Contest will take place on **November 3, 2018**.

:doc:`Registration is now open! <contest/registration>`

The early registration deadline is **11:59pm, Saturday, October 6**.

You must register by the early registration deadline to be guaranteed an ICPC t-shirt. If you miss the early registration deadline, you can still register by 11:59pm, Friday, October 19 (but you may not get a t-shirt on the day of the contest)

NOTE: Due to funding changes in ICPC, Mid-Central will start charging a registration fee this year to cover the cost of running the contest. Teams will need to pay a $30 per person fee to register (note: each coach pays the fee only once, not once per team).

Please see the :doc:`Registration <contest/registration>` page for instructions on how to register.
