<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Site Compiler Requirements</H1>

<P>Teams may elect to program in C, C++, Java, or Pascal. You must provide
compilers for these languages.

<H3>General Requirements</H3>

<OL>
<LI>You may <EM>not</EM> have more than one compiler per language.  For
example, you cannot provide both Visual C++ and gcc.  Sometimes code
that works fine with one compiler will not work with a different
compiler, and we can't risk that happening during the contest. (It
actually <EM>has</EM> happened in the past, hence the rule.)  Since most
modern C++ compilers also compile C, in practice most sites will have
three compilers: a Pascal compiler, a C/C++ compiler, and a Java
compiler.

<LI>If a compiler has an IDE, it must also have a command-line
equivalent. Contestants will prefer to use the IDE, but the judging
utilities require a command-line compiler.  Most modern IDEs also
provide a command-line equivalent.  <EM>It is your responsibility to
ensure that the default settings for both the IDE and command-line
compiler match!</EM>  If they use different settings for optimization,
debugging, memory model, etc., it may happen that a program will work
correctly for the contestant when using the IDE but fail when the
judges test it.  This too has happened in a previous contest.

<LI>You may <EM>not</EM> provide teams with a CD-ROM or other removable
media that contains the compiler to be used during the contest.  (Of
course you may distribute whatever you want <EM>after</EM> the contest.)
Some books and promotional materials contain CDs with a working
compiler, and in the past at least one site asked to use such a CD
during the contest.  The idea was to give each team a CD that they
would then use during the contest, rather than installing a compiler
on each machine. The problem is that all CDs (and Zip disks, etc)
look alike, so it is very difficult to ensure that teams don't have a
CD that they're not supposed to.

<LI>You are not required to provide a symbolic debugger for each
language.  Virtually all IDEs provide one, but many command-line-only
compilers do not.

<LI>You must provide compilers for all supported languages unless you
have written confirmation from all team moderators attending your site
that a particular language will not be used.

</OL>

<H3>Language-Specific Requirements</H3>

<DL>
<DT>C
<DD>The compiler must conform to the ANSI C specification.  All modern
compilers do.
<DT>C++
<DD>The compiler must support the Standard Template Library as defined
in Stroustrup's <I>The C++ Programming Language 3/e</I>.  There are at
least three different implementations of the STL in use by the major
C++ compilers, each with its own idiosyncracies, so expecting 100%
conformance is unrealistic at present.  As a practical matter it is
sufficient for the implementation to support the modern iostream
library, strings, and the basic containers (including <I>vector</I>,
<I>list</I>, <I>stack</I>, <I>queue</I>, <I>deque</I>, <I>priority</I>_<I>queue</I>, <I>set</I>, and <I>map</I>).
<DT>Java
<DD>The minimum requirement is compatibility with Sun's JDK 1.1.x,
although we strongly encourage you to provide a compiler based on Java 2 SDK
1.2 or higher. Sites using JDK 1.1.x should also provide the JDK 1.1
Collections package, available at 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/beans/infobus/index.html#DOWNLOAD_COLLECTIONS">
http://java.sun.com/beans/infobus/index.html#DOWNLOAD_COLLECTIONS</A>
   (Look for the Continue button for the JDK 1.1 collections,
   then you get led through the Terms And Conditions ....
   Make sure the package is accessible from your classpath.)

<DT>Pascal
<DD>Select either Turbo Pascal 5.5 or Turbo Pascal 7.0 for MS-DOS.
</DL>

<H3>Free Compilers</H3>

<P>You will probably just use the compilers that you normally provide
for your students. If they are not acceptable, or if you want to
consider other alternatives, here are a few free compilers.

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/">Borland
C++ 5.5</A>
<DD>A very good C/C++ compiler. No debugger. For Win 9x/NT/2000.
<DT><A HREF="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">djgpp</A>
<DD>A version of <I>gcc</I> that runs under plain old DOS.  Make sure you
get the latest release, which is based on <I>gcc</I> 2.95.2.
<DT><A HREF="http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/gcc.html">gcc
2.95.2</A>
<DD>The excellent <I>gcc</I> C/C++ compiler for Win 9x/NT/2000. Select the
<I>mingw</I>32 version.
<DT><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Java 2 SDK 1.3</A>
<DD>The latest version of Sun's Java Development Kit, the standard by
which others are judged.  For Win 9x/NT/2000.
<DT><A HREF="http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,20803,00.html">Turbo
Pascal 5.5</A>
<DD>A bit long in the tooth, but supports all the important features
of Turbo Pascal 7.0.
