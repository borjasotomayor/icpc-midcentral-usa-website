   <p>As a member of the International Rock-Skipping League, you travel to a
   different lake each week and compete in a rock-skipping contest. The goal is
   to throw a rock so that it skips as many times as possible; the exact rules
   for determining the winner are given below. To make the competitions
   interesting, the IRSL often chooses lakes with logs, sandbars, and other
   obstacles. You are provided with a side-view, water-level "map" of the lake
   as shown in the top line of the example below. (The numbers 0..29 below the
   map are just for reference.) A period (".") indicates clear water, where a
   rock will skip; any other character indicates some kind of obstacle that
   will stop a rock.</p>

   <blockquote>
      <tt>...=...**..#...@....:.:.:..=..</tt><br>
      <tt>______________________________</tt><br>
      <tt>          11111111112222222222</tt><br>
      <tt>012345678901234567890123456789</tt>
   </blockquote>

   <p>You stand at the left end of the lake. You can throw a rock so that it
   lands at any position in the lake, and then skips at any fixed interval
   thereafter. So a throw can be defined as a pair (<i>i</i>,<i>d</i>), where
   <i>i</i> &ge; 0 is the initial landing position and <i>d</i> &gt; 0 is the
   distance between skips. Note that <i>d</i> must be positive. The
   <dfn>count</dfn> of a throw is the number of times that it skips on the
   water. The <dfn>length</dfn> is the position of its last contact with either
   the water or an obstacle. To rank two distinct throws, use the following
   criteria, in order, until a winner is determined: count (highest wins);
   length (greatest wins); initial position (greatest wins); distance between
   skips (smallest wins).</p>

   <p>For the map shown above, throw (27,2) hits the obstacle at position 27;
   it has count 0 and length 27. Throw (16,1) skips at positions 16, 17, 18,
   and 19, then hits the obstacle at position 20; it has count 4 and length 20,
   so it beats throw (27,2). Throw (2,7) skips at positions 2, 9, 16, and 23,
   then skips over the lake; it has count 4 and length 23, so it beats throw
   (16,1). Throw (1,4) skips at positions 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and 29, then
   skips over the lake; it has count 8 and distance 29, and is the best
   possible throw for this lake.</p>

   <p><b>Input:</b> The input consists of one or more lake maps, each
   1&#8211;40 characters long and on a line by itself, followed by a line
   containing only "END" that signals the end of the input. Positions within a
   map are numbered starting with zero. Maps will only contain printable ASCII
   punctuation characters. A period indicates clear water and any other
   character indicates an obstacle.</p>

   <p><b>Output:</b> For each map, compute the best possible throw
   (<i>i</i>,<i>d</i>), then output a line containing <i>i</i> and <i>d</i>
   separated by one space.</p>
