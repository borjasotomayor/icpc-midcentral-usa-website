To use these to compile and run all judges programs under Windows:

Copy all these .cmd files to the main mcpc20xx directory.  
Only run them from that directory.

*  sol2flop.cmd  -- copies all judges' solutions to a floppy disk, 
so you can use then to test correct execution with the grading
utilities.  Modify copysrc.cmd if you want to copy somewhere other 
than a:.

*  solCompile.cmd  -- compiles all judges' solutions automatically into
individual problem directories.  This is needed before the following:

*  solOut.cmd [fileSuffix]--  runs all solutions, allowing you to see if any
take long on your system.  If the fileSuffix is omitted, output goes to the
screen.  If the fileSuffix is specified, output goes to a file in the problem
directory named by concatenating the problem name and the suffix.  You must
compile first with solCompile.
