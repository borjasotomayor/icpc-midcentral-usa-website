<p>Read the <a href="errors.html">Error Messages</a>,  <a
 href="teams.html">Notes to Teams</a>, and  <a href="sites.html">Notes to
Sites</a> right now. </p>

<p>Really, read those first. OK, now pass Go and collect $200.</p>

<p>Clarifications and corrections will be posted on the web at the top of
 the standings pages, so <i>be sure to check the standings regularly, even
 if you have no scores to enter.</i> </p>

<p>The judges' CD contains one subdirectory for each problem, which
  includes the description in HTML, the source file, the input and output
files,  and either an executable program or Java bytecode files. It contains
a subdirectory called <tt>NOTES</tt> that includes the HTML source for these
notes. It also contains a subdirectory called <tt>JUDGE</tt> that includes
the version of the judging utilities used in the last several contests.
If you do not already have a tried-and-true method for judging, you might
want to take a look at them. Instructions are provided in <a
 href="util.html">Using the Judging Utilities</a>. </p>

<p>The judge's input and output files in the individual problem directories
  and the judging utilities are for a Windows environment. The <tt>unix</tt>
  subdirectory contains all the input and output files with unix newline
'<tt>\n</tt>'  rather than the two character Windows versions. This distinction
is important  for grading by exact output file matching. </p>

<p>All the textual information on the judges' disk can be viewed
through a Web browser by accessing <tt>browse.html</tt> in the
<tt>mcpc2004</tt> directory installed by the judging utilities (or on
the judges' CD).  </p>

<p>Regardless of what judging method you use, remember the following (the
 included utilities take care of these details for you): </p>

<ul>

<li>Remove a team's diskette or write-protect it before judging to
ensure that nothing is written to it.</li>

<li>Always copy a fresh set of correct input and output files before
judging a run, because teams' programs have been known to trash
files.</li>

<li>If a program is correct, the team's output file will match the
correct output file <em>exactly</em>, i.e., they must be byte-for-byte
identical. If the match is not exact, you will have to do a visual
inspection to tell whether the problem is a wrong answer or a
presentation error.</li>

</ul>

<p> Each submitted run must be judged by at least two judges. This helps
guard  against procedural mistakes and ensures some dialog between judges.
This is especially critical when choosing between <i>Wrong Answer</i> and
<i>Presentation Error</i>, where there can be room for differences of opinion.
Presentation errors are ancillary or non-essential mistakes. Sometimes it's
easy to categorize presentation errors, sometimes not. For example, consider
a program that is supposed to print 3.1415. If it prints 4.23, that is obviously
a wrong answer. If it prints 3.14159, then it is a presentation error for
printing too many digits. But what about if it prints 3? This could be from
not printing enough digits, or it could be because the programmer used integers
instead of real numbers, or it could be an incorrect algorithm. These are
kinds of issues that require discussion. Unresolved or heavily debated issues
should always be presented to the Head Judge, who is the final arbiter. </p>

<p>As in recent contests, </p>

<ul>
      <li>problem solutions are unique and must be formatted exactly, so
output  can be judged using a file comparison utility,</li>
      <li>all problems are judged with one test file (which of course will
 include multiple test cases), and</li>
      <li>all input files have sentinels that signal the end of the input,
 so it is not necessary for teams to detect end-of-file. (End-of-file handling
 differs between languages and sometimes between different compilers for the
 same language. It can cause problems for teams using tools that they're not
 used to.)</li>

</ul>

<p>We have some <a href="probnotes.html">notes about the problem set</a>,
including who wrote them and their relative difficulty.</p>

<p>We need fresh ideas.  Please submit a problem!  See <a

<p>John Cigas will be your regional contact during the contest. If you have
 any questions or corrections you can send him email at <a
 href="mailto:cigas@acm.org">cigas@acm.org</a>, or if it's an emergency you
 can phone him at 816-501-4534. </p>
