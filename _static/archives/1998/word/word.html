<P>In millions of newspapers across the United States there is a word
game called <I>Jumble</I>.  The object of this game is to solve a
riddle, but in order to find the letters that appear in the answer it
is necessary to unscramble four words.  Your task is to write a
program that can unscramble words.

<P>The input file contains four parts: 1) a dictionary, which consists
of at least one and at most 100 words, one per line; 2) a line
containing <TT>XXXXXX</TT>, which signals the end of the dictionary; 3) one
or more scrambled 'words' that you must unscramble, each on a line by
itself; and 4) another line containing <TT>XXXXXX</TT>, which signals the end
of the file.  All words, including both dictionary words and scrambled
words, consist only of lowercase English letters and will be at least
one and at most six characters long.  (Note that the sentinel <TT>XXXXXX</TT>
contains <EM>uppercase</EM> <TT>X</TT>'s.)  The dictionary is not necessarily in
sorted order, but each word in the dictionary is unique.  

<P>For each scrambled word in the input, output an alphabetical list
of all dictionary words that can be formed by rearranging the letters
in the scrambled word.  Each word in this list must appear on a line
by itself.  If the list is empty (because no dictionary words can be
formed), output the line &#34;<TT>NOT A VALID WORD</TT>&#34; instead.  In either
case, output a line containing six asterisks to signal the end of the
list.
