<p>The <dfn>D-pairs</dfn> of a string of letters are the ordered pairs
of letters that are distance D from each other.  A string is
<dfn>D-unique</dfn> if all of its D-pairs are different.  A string is
<dfn>surprising</dfn> if it is D-unique for every possible distance
D.</p>

<p>Consider the string ZGBG. Its 0-pairs are ZG, GB, and BG. Since
these three pairs are all different, ZGBG is 0-unique. Similarly, the
1-pairs of ZGBG are ZB and GG, and since these two pairs are
different, ZGBG is 1-unique.  Finally, the only 2-pair of ZGBG is ZG,
so ZGBG is 2-unique.  Thus ZGBG is surprising.  (Note that the fact
that ZG is both a 0-pair and a 2-pair of ZGBG is irrelevant, because
0 and 2 are different distances.)</p>

<p><b>Input:</b> The input consists of one or more nonempty strings of
at most 79 uppercase letters, each string on a line by itself,
followed by a line containing only an asterisk that signals the end of
the input.</p>

<p><b>Output:</b> For each string of letters, output whether or not it
is surprising using the <em>exact</em> output format shown below.</p>

&quot;Puzzling Adventures&quot; column in the December 2003 issue of
<i>Scientific American</i>.</p>
