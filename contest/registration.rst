Registration
============

To register a team, please do the following:

* Register the team on the `ICPC Registration System <https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/finder/Mid-Central-USA-2018>`_.
* Pay the registration fee on this site: LINK

The early registration deadline is **11:59pm, Tuesday, October 9**.

You must register by the early registration deadline to be guaranteed an ICPC t-shirt. If you miss the early registration deadline, you can still register by 11:59pm, Friday, October 19 (but you may not get a t-shirt on the day of the contest)

NOTE: Due to funding changes in ICPC, Mid-Central will start charging a registration fee this year to cover the cost of running the contest. Teams will need to pay a $30 per person fee to register (note: each coach pays the fee only once, not once per team).


Coach's FAQ
-----------

**How do I register a second/assistant coach?**

In the ICPC Registration system, add the additional coach to the team as an Attendee, then type in Assistant Coach as both the Badge Role and the Certificate Role. See a screenshot.

**How do I cancel a team reservation?**

You have to contact the Regional Contest Director to cancel a reservation.
