Rules
=====

The ICPC maintains the official rules that apply by default to all regional contests. Individual regions may clarify and/or extend these rules as they see fit. Most of the clarifications and extensions for the Mid-Central USA regional contest are defined in the following two documents, which are provided to each team on the day of the contest.

Notes to Teams (includes tie-breaking rules)
Additional rules are described below.

Electronic Devices

Except for simple watches, teams may not have any electronic devices in their possession during the contest. This includes, but is not limited to, phones and other communication devices, calculators, calculator watches, PDAs, electronic translators or dictionaries, e-books, audio players/recorders, video players/recorders, scanners, and printers. Mere possession of such a device will result in immediate disqualification, regardless of whether or not it was used.

Late Registration

There is no late registration. If you do not register via the ICPC web site by the posted deadline, you cannot participate.

Machine-Readable Media

Teams may not possess any machine-readable electronic or magnetic media during the contest unless provided by the site explicitly for contest use. Violation of this rule will result in immediate disqualification, regardless of intent or whether the media were actually used.

Mathematical Knowledge

Up to 25% of the Mid-Central Regional Competition may include higher math as described below. That means a maximum of 1 problem out of a contest with 6-7 problems, or 2 problems out of 8-11.

Higher math may include:

matrix operations: multiplication, addition, subtraction
3D vector operations: addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, triple scalar product as volume
root finding of continuous functions by bisection
calculus of one variable topics: finding extrema with the help of derivatives
In other situations needed mathematical formulas will be provided, for instance for statistics.

Number of Problems

We are required to have at least six problems, and we will never have more than nine. The exact number will be posted on the home page a few days before the contest.

Reference Materials

The World Finals only allow teams to have 25 pages of reference material in PDF format, which is verified and printed out for the team for its use during the contest. For the Mid-Central USA contest, teams may bring any amount of printed reference material, including printouts of source code. If you have a book that includes a CD, be sure to leave the CD at home; see above.

Registration Priority

Our primary goal is to maximize the number of teams that participate in the contest; our secondary goal is to maximize the number of schools.

(1) Schools may register as many teams as they like before the registration deadline. The ICPC web site automatically time-stamps each registration and marks it "pending". (2) No registrations will be allowed after the deadline, period. (3) Until the deadline, teams will be "accepted" in the order that they registered, up to a maximum of two teams per school, as long as space is available. (4) Third, fourth, and higher teams from a school will always be left "pending" until after the deadline. (5) After the deadline, if any space is available, third teams will be accepted in the order that they registered, then fourth teams will be accepted in the order that they registered, and so on.
There is no limit on the number of teams that may compete from a single institution assuming that sufficient space is available. However, a school's teams may only compete at a single site.

Programs must be in a single source file with the name specified in the problem description; failure to meet this requirement is a Submission Error. Java programmers, note that you can include additional top-level classes in a single source file as long as they are unqualified (just "class", without "public").  Java programmers, note as well that your source file must not be declared as a part of a named package. That means you should not have a line at the top of your source code like: package someName;
All output will be judged using a file comparison utility, so output must be exactly as shown in the examples. This applies to all problems, whether explicitly stated in the problem description or not. Spelling, punctuation, spacing, and case (uppercase/lowercase) are all significant.
Make sure you know your site's specific time limit for program execution.  That may affect how you revise the efficiency of some programs.
Programs must write their results to standard output (usually stdout in C, cout in C++, and System.out in Java). The judges will ignore all output to standard error (usually stderr in C, cerr/clog in C++, and System.err in Java), so you can write as much debugging information to standard error as you want, subject to your site's time limit.
Your program cannot require any intervention by the user. For example, if you pause the program and ask the user to press a key to continue, you will be flagged with a Submission Error. If you pause the program without any prompting at all, you may be flagged with a Time Limit Exceeded error.
Do not use drive and/or path specifications when naming input files. If a problem indicates that the input file is named file.in, then you must open file.in and not a:file.in or c:\stuff\file.in or anything else. Violating this rule will result in a Submission Error.
All test cases used in judging will conform to the input specifications. It is not necessary for you to detect invalid input.
Input data and correct output data will obey the following rules.
Other than end-of-line characters, spaces are the only whitespace that appear.
Two or more consecutive spaces do not appear, unless specifically mentioned in the problem statement.
Spaces do not appear at the end of lines.
Spaces do not appear at the beginning of lines, unless specifically mentioned in the problem statement.
Blank lines do not appear.
All lines, including the last line, end with the standard end-of-line marker.
This applies only to Java programmers. Counter to Java conventions, the name of your source file and main class must be in lowercase for this competition. For example, if a problem states that your program must be called compute, then you would create a file called compute.java that begins like this:
public class compute {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        ...
    }
    ....
}
Teams are ranked by the number of problems solved, with teams solving the same number of problems ranked by least total time (see Regional Scoring). Teams solving the same number of problems with the same total time are ranked by the smallest elapsed time of their last accepted solution (not counting penalties for rejected runs). Any remaining ties are left unbroken unless they affect the regional winners, in which case they are broken by a coin flip.
Any team that jeopardizes the integrity of the contest or violates the rules of the contest will be disqualified and the team members may be banned permanently from competing in the Mid-Central Region. Some examples of such actions are:
accessing the Internet in any way,
disrupting power to computers,
corrupting judging materials or the judging process,
collaborating with anyone not on the team (this includes using a portable phone),
disobeying site officials' instructions regarding appropriate conduct.
