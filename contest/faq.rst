Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Can I use a programming language other than C, C++, or Java for the contest?

No. Allowing additional languages would cause more work for the Site Directors (who must install the necessary software) and the Regional Chief Judges (who must write judging utilities for the language). Also, there is a fairness issue: programs written in scripting languages like Perl and very high level languages like Haskell are often an order of magnitude shorter than programs written in traditional languages.

Does it matter which language I use?

Contest problems are designed with C++ and Java programmers in mind, so C programmers may be at a disadvantage. C++ and Java are roughly comparable, so pick whichever one you're most familiar with.

What mathematical knowledge is needed for the contest?

Up to 25% of the Mid-Central Regional Competition may include higher math as described below. That means a maximum of 1 problem out of a contest with 6-7 problems, or 2 problems out of 8-11.

Higher math may include:

matrix operations: multiplication, addition, subtraction
3D vector operations: addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, triple scalar product as volume
root finding of continuous functions by bisection
calculus of one variable topics: finding extrema with the help of derivatives
In other situations needed mathematical formulas will be provided, for instance for statistics.
