Information for Coaches
=======================

The coach is the official point-of-contact with the team prior to and during contest activities. 
A team may only have one coach and the coach cannot also be a contestant.

Whether you are seasoned ICPC coach, or you're just exploring the possibility
of sending teams to the ICPC Mid-Central USA regional contest, you should make
sure you've done the following:

#. Assemble one or more teams, each consisting of *exactly* three `eligible <http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules#HTeamComposition>`_ students each, plus an optional reserve. 
   This `PDF flowchart <http://icpc.baylor.edu/download/regionals/rules/EligibilityDecisionTree-2015.pdf>`_ can help you
   determine whether a contestant is eligible to participate in ICPC.
#. Fully :doc:`register <../contest/registration>` your team(s) before the deadline. 
   You must provide complete team member information before the deadline, or the registration will be cancelled.
#. Understand the regional contest :doc:`rules <../contest/rules>`.
#. Study the :doc:`notes to teams <../contest/notes>`.
#. Be familiar with the :doc:`contest environment <../contest/environment>` contest environment and 
   your :doc:`site's facilities <../contest/site_facilities>`.
