Information for Site Directors
==============================

This page contains information for Site Directors. If you have any questions on
getting your site ready, make sure you reach out to the :doc:`Regional Contest Director <../contact>`.

Preparing for the Contest
-------------------------

Make sure you have reviewed the :doc:`Site Requirements <site_requirements>` and, in particular,
the Internet access requirements. The contest is run with `Kattis <https://open.kattis.com/>`_, the
same judging system used at the ICPC World Finals and at many other contests worldwide. You must
ensure that contestants have access only to the Kattis site (the :doc:`Site Requirements <site_requirements>`
page includes a list of ways in which you can secure your site) and that the provided compilers
match, as closely as possible, the compilers used by the Kattis system.

In preparation for the contest, our Director of Systems will be running a number of dry runs using
the exact same setup we will use on the day of the contest. We strongly encourage you to participate
in these dry runs to ensure that everything is working correctly on your end.

Document Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each team must get a copy of the following documents, which you should print in advance of the contest,
and provide to teams when they register on-site:

* `Kattis Team Guide <http://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/programming-environment/Kattis-Team-Guide-V1.4.pdf>`_ (1 per team)
* Kattis login sheet (1 per team). The login sheets will be sent to the site directors the week before the contest. 
* :doc:`Notes to Teams <../contest/notes>` (1 per team)
* Practice Problem set (3 per team). This problem set will be available the week before the contest.

If necessary you should provide *site-specific instructions*. Here are some aspects on which you
may need to provide site-specific instructions:

* Login information for the contest machines.
* Instructions on how to run the compilers, specially if it will be easy for students
  to inadvertently run the compiler in a way that is subtantially different than the Kattis setup
  (e.g., if your C++ compiler does not use C++11 by default)

Day of the Contest
------------------

#. Each year one of the regional chief judges will act as the contest-day point of 
   contact to handle all questions and corrections. This year's contact is TBD.
#. The site director will have a sealed envelope that must be opened in the presence
   of at least two other coaches from two different schools. This envelope will contain 
   the password for the contest materials, including PDFs of each of the problems. The 
   site director must then make three copies of the problem set per team, plus copies 
   for the coaches as needed. He or she may delegate that task to two of the coaches, 
   if necessary. Under no circumstances should any student be allowed access to the 
   problem set before the contest starts, whether a contestant or not.
#. All contest-day administration will be done via the Kattis website. Judging is done 
   automatically by the Kattis site, so there is no need to have on-site judges. 
   Nonetheless, site directors (and anyone the site director designates) will be given 
   judge privileges on Kattis so they can see all submissions and judgements.
#. Once the contest begins, if there are any teams that did not show up, call or email 
   the :doc:`Regional Contest Director <../contact>`.


Immediately after the Contest
-----------------------------

Site Directors will have access to the unfrozen scoreboard on the Kattis site. 
However, You should not reveal this scoreboard until the Regional Contest 
Director sends out an "all clear". In that message, the RCD will include an
XML file that you can use to run ICPC's scoreboard resolver (see the 
`ICPC Tools page <http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpctools/>`_. We encourage you
to use this tool, as it makes for a very exciting reveal of the final results
for the entire region.
